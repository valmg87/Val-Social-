## The Challenge:

The challenge was to build a RESTful API that allows a social media startup to perform CRUD operations on users, thoughts, and reactions data models using a NoSQL database. The API must be built using Node.js and Mongoose and must provide endpoints that can handle large amounts of unstructured data.

## Assigned User Story:
```
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```

## Acceptance Criteria:
```GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
```

## Usage Instructions:
1. Repository: Open documentation run 'npm i' and update '.env'.
2. Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add the following variables:
3. Once the server is running, use a tool like Insomnia to test the API endpoints. 
4. Use Insomnia to test http://localhost:3001 with the following route end points API GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for categories, products, and tags, ensuring successful creation, updating, and deletion of data in the database.
